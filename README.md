# Air Medical Service Flights Analysis - Capstone Project
## Problem Context:
**Domain:** Air Medical Services and Health Care\
**End - Users:** Aeromedical Service Providers and the Federal Government\
**Importance of problem:** 
- Aeromedical flights play a crucial role in offering services to the rural areas that lack healthcare benefits.
- Hospitals operating in cities are vital to the quality of life and economy of communities throughout the region.

The accessibility to health and medical services for rural residents is reduced. The project aims to provide insights on the operations of current aeromedical services and predict flight demand for the next few days.

## Problem Statement: 
- Machine Learning Models to predict the flight demand and need for ILS equipment at the airports.
- Examine the number of flights from/to Origin/Destination.
- Perform Cluster Analysis of flights from/to Origin/Destination.
- Develop flight tracker from/to Origin/Destination for flight hops and route analysis. 
- Analyze duration and distance statistics for each tail number to find out data anomalies.

## Dashboard
The Tableau dashboard provides insights into the current aeromedical service operations to bridge the gap between service providers and Federal Government. This includes insights on the number of flights per provider, flightâ€™s operating locations, flight route tracking system, night and daytime flights, flight operations based on weather conditions, and predict the flight demand for the next few days based on the previous pattern and trend in flight operations.
